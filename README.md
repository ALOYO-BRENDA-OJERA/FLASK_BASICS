It was so interesting. i enjoyed it. 
the problem i  faced was about the css style linking part, where i came across things like jinja2 syntax, which still failed to work.
Then also the part where i had to modify one of the routes, to handle both post and GET methods, the program would then over ride the chosen route.
There is also an isue of Github, where when i try to push, it fails to work and i have to use the -f, which the over writes all the previous work. at some point i started thinking all the apps require separate repos?

Note: All in all, it was greate trying  to learn it all from scratch.
